## Results
The analysis results are summarized as follows;
1. Total Revenue â€“ $90.1K
  - This Indicates strong overall product monetization.

2. Total Users â€“ 20.00K
  - This shows that you have acquired a substantial user base.

4. Returning Users â€“ 19K
  - High number of returning users shows very strong retention.

5. Return Rate â€“ 97%
  - Excellent retention! This Suggests the product delivers ongoing value.

    - Insight: User engagement and retention are exceptional, meaning most users come back after signing up. This is a sign of strong product-market fit.

ðŸ“ˆ Returning Users Over Time
  - Drop in June (12.1K from ~36K in May) is significant.
  - Steady performance before that, with slight seasonal dips and peaks.
     - Insight: Something may have happened in June â€” marketing pause, feature issue, or external factor.

ðŸ“Š Which Channel Brings Users Back?
  - Email leads in returning users, followed by Google Ads and Organic.
  - All channels show significant contributions, but some outperform in retention.
   - Insight: Email marketing is the strongest for retention. Consider investing more in that channel and replicating its approach in others.

ðŸ’µ Which Users Spend the Most Money?
  - Most users spend $0, but a few spend $10â€“$20, with Paid Plan users contributing more.
     - Insight: The monetization model likely depends on a small group of high-value users. Might be worth segmenting and nurturing them (e.g., upsell or reward).

ðŸ“ˆ Revenue by Channel
- Revenue is evenly spread across all channels (~19â€“22%).
- No one channel dominates revenue generation.
  -  Insight: All acquisition sources convert into revenue fairly equally. Itâ€™s safe to diversify your marketing spend rather than rely on one source.

 Whatâ€™s Working:
- User retention is excellent (97%)
- Email and Organic channels drive strong re-engagement
- Revenue is healthy and evenly distributed
- Paid plan contributes more to revenue

 What Needs Attention:
- Sudden dip in June: investigate for potential product or marketing issues.
- Majority of users spend $0, we need strategies to improve conversion (e.g., trials, in-app nudges)
- Very few high spenders, we need to explore upsell strategies or loyalty features.



## Recommendations
Based on the analysis and results, I recommend the following actions ;
1. Investigate June drop-off: Was there a bug, campaign stop, or experience change?
2. Leverage high-performing channels: Boost Email efforts and see why it performs best.
3. Increase monetization efforts: Offer limited-time features, bundles, or loyalty programs.
4. Segment high-value users: Create dashboards or alerts around power users for retention and upsell.
